This is a very basic Mp3Handler, using a player from http://flash-mp3-player.net/
which is free and opensource, released under CC-BY-SA.

To install:

1. Create the extensions/Mp3Handler/ directory
2. Put Mp3Handler.php, download.png and mp3player.swf into extensions/Mp3Handler/
3. Add require_once( "$IP/extensions/Mp3Handler/Mp3Handler.php" ); to LocalSettings.php

Advanced:

If your extensions directory is in a non-standard location, you'll have to update:

1. $wgMp3playerPath (default: $wgScriptPath/extensions/Mp3Handler/mp3player.swf)
2. $wgMp3DownloadIcon (default: $wgScriptPath/extensions/Mp3Handler/download.png)

If you want to make sure that "download" really does download, instead of
playing in the browser, you should configure your webserver to set the mimetype
to "application/octet-stream", you can override $wgMp3DownloadPath if that
makes this easier for you.
