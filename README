This is a very basic Mp3Handler that relies on dewplayer, dewplayer is not
"free", it is released under the CC-BY-ND license, though it costs no money.

To install:

1. create the extensions/Mp3Handler/ directory
2. Put Mp3Handler.php, download.png and dewplayer.swf into extensions/Mp3Handler.php
3. Add require_once( "$IP/extensions/Mp3Handler/Mp3Handler.php" ); to LocalSettings.php

Advanced:

If your extensions directory is in a non-standard location, you'll have to update:

1. $wgDewplayerPath (default: $wgScriptPath/extensions/Mp3Handler/dewplayer.swf)
2. $wgMp3DownloadIcon (default: $wgScriptPath/extensions/Mp3Handler/download.png)

If you want to make sure that "download" really does download, instead of
playing in the browser, you should configure your webserver to set the mimetype
to "application/octet-stream", you can override $wgMp3DownloadPath if that
makes this easier for you.

If you want to add support for different Mp3 players to this extension (ideally
"free" ones) please do, if you haven't access to Subversion, my contact details
are at http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/USERINFO/conrad?view=markup.
